# Cardinality-pruning in the greedy optimizer is keyed to the optimization metric

## Context

The greedy optimizer's cost is dominated by physical reorders (`update_storage_dimension_order`), and reorders that move a high-**cardinality** dimension are the most expensive. To cut that cost, the size-aware greedy uses each dimension's **cardinality** (leaf-element count — a cheap, reorder-free signal) to *prune* which dimensions are test-reordered into each position, and to *pin* confidently-placed dimensions out of the search entirely.

But cardinality only predicts *some* of the things OptimusPy optimizes for. It is a strong prior for **RAM** placement (high-cardinality sparse dimensions compress best toward the back — the basis of `_compute_suggested_order`). It is a weaker prior for **query time** (a query-leading dimension can be any cardinality; `docs/concepts/ram-vs-query-tradeoff.md` notes a small dim early is good for RAM but can be bad for queries that filter on it). It predicts **process duration** not at all — the only KPI is wall-clock, and nothing about a dimension's cardinality forecasts it.

A grounding fact from `executors.py:350-365`: the greedy's **back-half positions are always ranked by RAM**, regardless of config. Only the front half's ranking changes — query time when `views` are set, else process time when `processes` are set, else RAM.

## Decision

Apply cardinality-driven pruning and pinning **only where the ranking metric is something cardinality can predict**:

1. **RAM-ranked positions → prune (and pin).** This always includes the entire back half, plus every position on a RAM-only cube. Strong prior.
2. **Query-ranked front positions (views set) → prune, but with a wider candidate window** than RAM positions. The prior is weaker, so we keep more neighbors in play; the empirical query-time measurement among the survivors still picks the winner, which de-risks the weaker prior.
3. **Process-ranked front positions (processes set, no views) → do not prune.** Cardinality cannot predict process duration, so these positions are searched in full among the non-pinned dimensions. The RAM-ranked back half of the same cube is still pruned and pinned, because the algorithm was already optimizing the back for RAM regardless.

Pinning is fundamentally a RAM/back-placement decision: a pinned dimension is placed at its cardinality-implied slot (back, for the extreme high-cardinality dim) and never test-reordered. It therefore applies whenever the back half is in play — i.e. always — but it never fabricates a placement for a metric cardinality can't predict.

When cardinality gives no signal at all (all dimensions similarly sized — low confidence), pruning switches off and the greedy falls back to exhaustive behavior.

## Considered alternatives

- **Prune everything by cardinality, including process-ranked positions.** Rejected: it would silently bias process-only cubes toward a RAM-optimal layout that has no bearing on process duration, presenting a guessed order as a measured one.
- **Prune RAM-ranked positions only; never prune query positions.** Rejected: it throws away most of the savings whenever `views` are set (the common case), for a risk that empirical measurement among a widened candidate set already covers.
- **Keep process-only cubes fully exhaustive (no pinning either).** Rejected: it forfeits the safe, real savings available on the RAM-ranked back half, where no process prediction is being made. A process-only cube that wants the full speedup can add a view.

## Consequences

- The speedup a cube gets is proportional to how much of its ranking is RAM- or query-driven. RAM-only and query cubes benefit most; process-only cubes benefit only on their back half.
- The optimizer never presents a cardinality-guessed placement as if it were measured for a metric cardinality can't predict.
- Documentation must state plainly that **adding a view unlocks front-half pruning** — it is the user-facing lever for making a slow process-only cube fast.
